## Purpose

1. Encourage players to explore longer, move base more freely, and compact storage systems.

2. Fit with vanilla - avoid diminishing the value of vanilla features or drastically changing gameplay.

## Details

### Storage
Adds 2 blocks to the game:

<br/>

<br/>

Both are containers with 9 slots of inventory space. Together, the crates function like a one-way shulker box.

- Place a crate down and put items in it like any container.
- When you break the crate block, it will drop as a sealed crate with those items.
- When you place and break a sealed crate, the sealed crate will be destroyed and drop its contents.

Sealed crates can't be accessed by the player (unless in creative mode). Droppers and Hoppers also won't interact with it.

#### Other Details

- If you break an empty crate, it will just drop the crate again.
- If you break a sealed crate with silk touch, it will drop the sealed crate again.

<br/>

- Sealed crates and shulker boxes can't be stored in crates
- Both crates can be stored in shulker boxes

<br/>

- Crates stack to 64, sealed crates are unstackable
- Craft a crate with 4 iron ingots and 4 planks:

### Redstone
Dispensers can place crate blocks.

Pistons extending into crate blocks will break them, causing them to drop whatever they're expected to drop, similar to if a player did it.

Comparators read the fullness of the crates, like other containers.

Hoppers/droppers work as expected with crates, but do not interact with sealed crates.

### Decoration
Crates are directional, so placing at different orientations makes the diagonal go one way or the other. The wood color is based on spruce.
